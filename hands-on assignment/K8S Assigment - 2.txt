Assignment 1: Node Selector Practice
- Label node1 as env=dev, node2 as env=staging, node3 as env=prod
- Create 3 nginx deployments (dev-app, staging-app, prod-app) with nodeSelector matching each environment
- Verify pods are scheduled on correct nodes using kubectl get pods -o wide

Assignment 2: Affinity Rules
- Label one node with disktype=ssd
- Create a deployment with requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution for SSD nodes
- Add preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution for nodes with label memory=high
- Deploy and verify pod placement

Assignment 3: Anti-Affinity Setup
- Create a deployment with 3 replicas of an nginx pod
- Configure podAntiAffinity to prevent replicas from running on the same node
- Scale to 5 replicas and observe what happens when nodes are fewer than replicas

Assignment 4: Taints and Tolerations
- Taint node1 with key=special:NoSchedule
- Deploy a pod without tolerations and verify it doesn't schedule on node1
- Create another pod with matching toleration and confirm it schedules successfully

Assignment 5: Security Context
- Create a pod with securityContext setting runAsUser: 1000 and fsGroup: 2000
- Mount a volume and create a file inside the container
- Verify the file ownership and permissions

Assignment 6: Priority Classes
- Create 3 priority classes: high-priority (1000), medium-priority (500), low-priority (100)
- Deploy multiple pods with different priorities
- Simulate resource pressure and observe which pods get scheduled first
