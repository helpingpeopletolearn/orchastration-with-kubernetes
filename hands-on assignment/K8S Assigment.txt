1. Basic Pod Creation: Create a simple pod running an Nginx container. Write the YAML definition file from scratch and deploy it to your cluster.

2. Multi-Container Pod: Create a pod with two containers - one running Nginx and another running Redis. Make sure both containers can communicate with each other using localhost.

3. Resource Quotas:
- Create a new namespace called "practice-quota"
- Apply resource quotas limiting it to maximum 5 pods, 500m CPU request, and 512Mi memory
- Try creating pods within this namespace and observe the behavior

4. Static Pods: Create a static pod by placing a pod definition file in the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory on a worker node. Verify it runs automatically without using kubectl create.

5. Complete Application Deployment: Deploy the voting application discussed in class:
- Write deployment files for all 5 components (vote, redis, worker, database, result)
- Create appropriate services (4 services total)
- Use proper service types (LoadBalancer for vote and result, ClusterIP for redis and database)
- Verify the application works by accessing the voting interface

6.Pod Operations: Practice these kubectl commands:
- Describe a pod to see its lifecycle events
- Execute commands inside a running container
- View logs from specific containers in a multi-container pod
- Delete a pod and observe auto-healing behavior
- Service Configuration: Create services with different types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) and understand when to use each type.
