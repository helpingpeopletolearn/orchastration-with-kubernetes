Assignment 1: Ephemeral Volumes
- Create a pod with two containers sharing an EmptyDir volume
- Have one container write data to the volume and the other read from it
- Verify data is lost when the pod is deleted

Assignment 2: ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Create a ConfigMap with application configuration (database host, port, app settings)
- Create a Secret with database credentials
- Deploy a pod that mounts both as volumes and verify the data is accessible

Assignment 3: Persistent Volumes
- Create a PersistentVolume with 5Gi storage using local storage
- Create a PersistentVolumeClaim requesting 2Gi with ReadWriteOnce access
- Deploy a pod using this PVC and write some data to verify persistence across pod restarts

Assignment 4: NFS Storage
- Set up an NFS server and export a directory
- Create a PersistentVolume using NFS
- Deploy a MySQL database with persistent storage using the NFS volume
