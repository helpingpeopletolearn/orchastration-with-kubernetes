Assignment 1: Deployment and ReplicaSet Scenarios
- Create a simple deployment with matching labels between deployment selector and pod specification
- Create a deployment but have a pod with the same label running beforehand, observe how deployment manages total replicas
- Create a deployment with multiple labels in matchLabels section, but do not match any labels in pod specification. Have separate pods running with individual labels and observe the behavior

Assignment 2: Deployment Strategies
- Create a deployment using recreate strategy and observe pod replacement behavior
- Create a deployment using rolling update strategy (default) and make changes to the image, observe how pods are updated one by one
- Practice rollback commands - make multiple revisions and roll back to specific revision numbers

Assignment 3: ConfigMap Implementation
- Create a ConfigMap with database configuration (database name, URI, ports)
- Create pods that use the entire ConfigMap using envFrom
- Create pods that use specific keys from ConfigMap using valueFrom
- Verify environment variables inside the pods using kubectl exec

Assignment 4: Jobs and DaemonSets
- Create a simple job that executes a one-time command and verify completion status
- Create a DaemonSet and verify it runs on all worker nodes
- Observe what happens when you add or remove worker nodes with DaemonSet running

Assignment 5: Liveness Probes
- Create a pod with command-based liveness probe
- Create a pod with HTTP GET liveness probe for a web application
- Configure initialDelaySeconds, periodSeconds, timeoutSeconds, and failure thresholds

Assignment 6: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
- Deploy an application with resource limits defined
- Create HPA with minimum 1 and maximum 10 replicas based on 50% CPU utilization
- Generate load and observe automatic scaling behavior
